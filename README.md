#1  A line is drawn every frame until it reaches 10 pixels from the edge.

#2 The first 10 intitializes the i variable to 10, the second 10 sets the condition that the for loop will run until the i value is 10 less than the width of the canvas, and the third 10 adds 10 to the i varible each time the loop is run.

#3 The loop runs until the i> the length of the array. In this case it runs 5 times because x gets increased by 10 each run.

#4 The ring spacing can be changed by increasing the number that gets added to x each run or multiplying the (x.length-i) value by a # greater than one. 

#5 The ellipse trial cna be increased by increasing the value in the slice function parameters
